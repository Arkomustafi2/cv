        <p>
		Hello, I'm Arko Mustafi, Undergraduate Student, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering,University of Dhaka and Treasurer, IEEE Student Branch, University of Dhaka

I am a final-year undergraduate student majoring in Communications Engineering at the University of Dhaka, currently researching "Smart Agriculture Systems" and the "Development of 6G Technology." My academic journey is complemented by practical experience, including an internship with Grameenphone, where I gained valuable industry insights.

I actively contribute to professional communities as the Treasurer of the IEEE Student Branch at the University of Dhaka and as a volunteer with the IEEE Puzzlers Community. Previously, I served as a volunteer for IEEE PES Day and IEEE Day. Additionally, I dedicate myself to social service as a member of the Dhaka University Rover Scout Group.

Beyond academics and professional engagements, I am passionate about personal growth, exploring literature, traveling, and connecting with diverse individuals. I am always eager to learn and collaborate.
